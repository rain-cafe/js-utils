## Promises

### `delay`

Creates a delayed promise for the given amount of seconds and given promises.
This can be useful for allowing spinners / loading skeletons to exist for a bit rather then quickly popping in and out.

```tsx
import { delay } from '@rain-cafe/js-utils';

const promise = delay(); // Returns a promise with the preset delay
const promise = delay(1000); // Returns a promise with the given delay
const promise = delay(Promise.resolve('hello')); // Returns the original promise with the preset delay
const promise = delay(Promise.resolve('hello'), 1000); // Returns the original promise with the given delay
```

### `delay.fallback`

This overrides the default delay value

```tsx
import { delay } from '@rain-cafe/js-utils';

const promise = delay(); // Returns a promise with a delay of 500ms
delay.fallback(100);
const promise = delay(); // Returns a promise with a delay of 100ms
```

### `never`

Creates a promise that never resolves.
Primary use-case for this is testing loading states.

In the event a promise is passed it will log a warning in the console as a reminder not to leave it in.

```tsx
import { never } from '@rain-cafe/js-utils';

const promise = never(); // Returns a promise that never resolves
const promise = never(Promise.resolve('hello')); // Returns a promise that never resolves
```
